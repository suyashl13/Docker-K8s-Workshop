### Demonstrating Docker Networking Commands.

> ***Simple Exercise:*** Will create a new docker network. Attach two containers to it and will ping each other inside both of them.

1. Creating a new docker network.
```bash
$ docker network create my-bridge-network
```

2. Running a container and attaching it to the new network.
```bash
$ docker run -d --name container1 --network my-bridge-network nginx
$ docker run -d --name container2 --network my-bridge-network alpine sleep 1000
```

3. Pinging each other inside both of them.
```bash
$ docker exec container1 ping container2
```

<hr />

#### Results 
```bash
$ docker exec -it container2 ping container1
